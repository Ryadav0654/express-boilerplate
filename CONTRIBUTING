## Guidelines

- **Write Clean Code**: Ensure your code follows the existing coding standards and uses TypeScript features effectively.
- **Respect Existing Code**: Avoid making unnecessary changes to the existing codebase unless it's part of the feature or fix you're working on.
- **Run Linting and Formatting**: Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm prettier` before submitting a pull request.
- **Stay Updated**: Pull the latest changes from the main branch before creating a pull request:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
